EAGLE (Enhanced Acquisition Guidance Learning Engine)
Objectives: 
•	Objective 1: Build out the initial set of requirements (MVP) for the EAGLE application that can be used by the CORs to generate acquisition plan and send to OA Intake. (Need Ryan to confirm)
•	Objective 2: Design an agentic AI workflow that automate the Acquisition Planning processing. Essentially, a contractor specialist managing the entire AP workflow until its complete. (Need Ryan to confirm)
High-Level Acquisition Workflow
SOW+IGCE+MRR -> Acquisition Planning (AP) -> Solicitation (RFQ/RFP) -> Source Selection – Technical Evaluation -> Negotiation -> Pre-Award -> Award –> Administer -> Closeout
•	Ryan’s application is focus on the AP part of the workflow. The application is called EAGLE. The AP step requires gathering information needed and working with various folks to put together an acquisition plan. 
o	Ryan has a S3 bucket with different folders, 6 of them, each representing a role that is needed for the AP process. There is one supervisor role that help coordinate the activities.
o	After the AP is completed (got all the approvals) send it to OA Intake via the OA Intake API.
o	Future: Integrate with other system to feed information into the EAGLE App or send out to other system such as Merlin.
o	Pain Point: Design the application to minimize inference calls/token length to reduce cost.

•	Ryan is current using the chat tool to support acquisition planning
•	He wants EAGLE to have its own URL but for now tagging on to the research optimizer website
•	The chat interface web interface interacts with the model via the REST API - POST /api/model. Example of the payload below.
POST https://researchoptimizer-dev.cancer.gov/api/model

I'll compile a comprehensive feature list for EAGLE based on the design work we've done. This should give developers a clear technical roadmap.
EAGLE Development Features List

•	Context sharing and handoff protocols between agents
•	Agent memory management and session persistence
2. Knowledge Base Integration
•	AWS S3-based vector database system (Amazon S3 Vectors, not OpenSearch)
•	Real-time knowledge base querying across 8 specialized knowledge bases
•	Knowledge base sync monitoring and status tracking
•	Version control for regulatory content updates (FAR 2.0 tracking)
3. Authentication & Access Control
•	PIV card authentication (federal employees only)
•	Role-based access control (COR/CO vs Policy Group interfaces)
