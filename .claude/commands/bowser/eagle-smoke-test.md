# EAGLE Frontend Smoke Test

Log into the EAGLE frontend application and verify all major pages load correctly, the backend API responds, and the chat interface works end-to-end.

## Variables

| Variable | Value           | Description                                              |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| SKILL    | `claude-bowser` | Uses your real Chrome for browser automation             |
| MODE     | `headed`        | Visible browser (default)                                |
| URL      | `{PROMPT}` or `http://localhost:3000` | Base URL of the EAGLE frontend |

If {PROMPT} contains a URL, use that. Otherwise default to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Login

1. Navigate to {URL}/login
2. Verify the login page loads — look for:
   - The EAGLE logo (blue "E" in a rounded box)
   - "Sign in to your account" heading
   - Email and Password input fields
   - "Sign in" button
   - "National Cancer Institute — Office of Acquisitions" footer text
3. Take a screenshot of the login page
4. **Dev mode check**: If the page auto-redirects to the home page (no Cognito configured = dev mode), skip login form and go to Phase 2
5. If login form is present:
   - Enter email: `dev@example.com` in the email field
   - Enter password: `Password123!` in the password field
   - Click "Sign in"
   - Wait for redirect to home page (up to 10 seconds)
   - If login fails with an error banner, report the error and try navigating directly to {URL}/ (dev mode may auto-authenticate)

### Phase 2: Home Page Verification

6. Verify the home page loads — look for:
   - "EAGLE" branding in the header
   - Four feature cards: "Chat", "Document Templates", "Acquisition Packages", "Admin"
   - Each card should have an icon, title, description, and be clickable
7. Take a screenshot of the home page
8. Report: PASS or FAIL with details

### Phase 3: Chat Page Test

9. Click the "Chat" card or navigate to {URL}/chat
10. Verify the chat page loads — look for:
    - A sidebar navigation panel
    - A chat input area / message box
    - The EAGLE header
11. Take a screenshot of the chat page
12. Type a test message: "Hello, can you confirm you are the EAGLE acquisition assistant?"
13. Wait for a response (up to 30 seconds)
14. Verify:
    - A response appears from the assistant
    - No error messages displayed
    - The response mentions EAGLE, NCI, or acquisitions
15. Take a screenshot showing the conversation
16. Report: PASS or FAIL with response preview

### Phase 4: Documents Page Test

17. Navigate to {URL}/documents
18. Verify the documents page loads — look for:
    - A page heading or layout for documents
    - No error/crash screens
19. Take a screenshot
20. Report: PASS or FAIL

### Phase 5: Workflows Page Test

21. Navigate to {URL}/workflows
22. Verify the workflows page loads — look for:
    - Workflow-related content (package list, workflow cards, or empty state)
    - No error/crash screens
23. Take a screenshot
24. Report: PASS or FAIL

### Phase 6: Admin Page Test

25. Navigate to {URL}/admin
26. Verify the admin dashboard loads — look for:
    - Dashboard statistics or admin navigation
    - No error/crash screens or "Access Denied"
27. Take a screenshot
28. Report: PASS or FAIL

### Phase 7: Backend Health Check

29. Navigate to {URL}/api/health (or use the browser to fetch it)
30. Verify the response contains:
    - `"status": "healthy"`
    - `"service": "eagle-backend"`
    - `"version"` field present
31. Report: PASS or FAIL with response data

### Phase 8: Summary Report

32. Compile the results:

```
# EAGLE Smoke Test Report

**URL:** {URL}
**Date:** {current date and time}
**Auth Mode:** Dev Mode / Cognito
