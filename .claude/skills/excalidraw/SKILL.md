# Excalidraw Diagram Generator Skill

Automatically generate professional Excalidraw diagrams (`.excalidraw.md` files) from textual descriptions, specifications, or code analysis. This skill can be used by any expert to create visualizations relevant to their domain.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Diagram Type Recognition**
- Sequential flowcharts (with retry logic, decision points)
- Architecture diagrams (layered, containerized)
- Ecosystem/data flow diagrams (service interconnectivity)
- Concentric circle hierarchies (trust policies, access levels)
- AWS/cloud infrastructure diagrams
- Domain-specific visualizations (backend services, frontend components, deployment pipelines, etc.)

### 2. **Element Generation**
Generates all Excalidraw element types:
- **Rectangles**: Containers, services, components
- **Ellipses**: Circular nodes, state representations
- **Arrows**: Data flow, dependencies, connections
- **Text**: Labels, descriptions, documentation
- **Lines**: Boundaries, groupings

### 3. **Smart Positioning**
- Automatic grid-based layout
- Proper spacing between elements
- Vertical/horizontal flow detection
- Avoid element overlap
- Center-aligned compositions

### 4. **Styling & Theming**

**IMPORTANT**: Always follow the style guide in `docs/excalidraw-best-practices.md`. Key rules:
- **Dark canvas background**: `#1a1a1a` (NOT white)
- **Hachure fills**: Always use `fillStyle: "hachure"` (NOT solid) for shapes
- **Bright borders + dark fills**: e.g. stroke `#3b82f6`, background `#1e3a8a`
- **Hand-drawn roughness**: `roughness: 1` for organic feel
- **Monospace headers**: `fontFamily: 3` for titles, `fontFamily: 1` for body
- **Typography**: Title 48-60px, Section 32-36px, Body 16-20px
- **Stroke width**: 3-4px main borders, 2px secondary
- **Opacity**: 70-90 for subtle layering

**Color Palette (bright borders / dark fills)**:
| Role | Border | Fill |
|------|--------|------|
| Blue (API/Services) | `#3b82f6` | `#1e3a8a` |
| Orange (Data) | `#f59e0b` | `#92400e` |
| Red (Security) | `#ef4444` | `#7f1d1d` |
| Purple (Processing) | `#8b5cf6` | `#4c1d95` |
| Cyan (Output) | `#06b6d4` | `#164e63` |
| Green (Success) | `#10b981` | `#064e3b` |

**Text Colors**: Titles `#10b981` (green monospace), Labels `#ffffff`, Details `#6b7280`

### 5. **Advanced Features**
- Element grouping (`groupIds`)
- Arrow binding to connect elements
- Multi-column layouts
- Legend/key generation
- Status indicators (✅, ⚠️, ❌, 🟡)

## Sequence Diagram Templates

The skill supports sequence diagrams for multi-actor interaction flows, based on proven patterns from the EAGLE eval page diagrams.

**Key Features:**
- Standard actor layout with color-coded boxes (User, UI, Supervisor, Skills, Storage)
- Phase grouping with colored backgrounds (Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Red)
- Message types: user input, system actions, self-loops, return messages
- Consistent spacing: 200px actor gaps, 60px step height, 450px phase spacing

**Common Patterns:**
- Simple request-response flows
- Multi-phase workflows (Intake → Clarification → Determination → Document Generation)
- Skill invocation sequences (when user needs help)
- Quality check workflows (validation and review)

For detailed specifications, layout guidelines, and example patterns, see: `.claude/skills/excalidraw/templates/sequence-diagram.md`

## Concurrent Worker Pool Templates

The skill supports concurrent processing pipeline diagrams for visualizing worker pools, promise pools, and multi-step data flows.

**Key Features:**
- Zone-based layout separating Main Thread, Service Worker, and Worker areas
- Stacked queue visualization for task/item backlogs
- Promise Pool and Worker Pool ellipses showing concurrency
- Detailed worker internals with JS bindings and WASM modules
- Numbered pipeline steps (0-N) with annotations
- Decision diamonds for loop/branching logic
- Transfer mechanism annotations (ArrayBuffer, base64, etc.)

**Common Patterns:**
- Simple worker pipelines (Input → Queue → Pool → Worker → Output)
- Concurrent processing with external fetch (CDN/cache integration)
- WASM-based processing workers with subsetting
- Loop with decision points (Done? → Take next / Continue)

For detailed specifications, layout guidelines, and example patterns, see: `.claude/skills/excalidraw/templates/concurrent-worker-pool.md`

## Output Format

### Obsidian Excalidraw Format (REQUIRED)

Files MUST use the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin format (NOT raw JSON). Raw JSON files will NOT render.

**Required structure:**
- YAML frontmatter: `excalidraw-plugin: parsed` and `tags: [excalidraw]`
- Text Elements section with `^element-id` anchors
- Drawing section wrapped in `%%` with json code block
- File extension: `.excalidraw.md` (NOT `.excalidraw` or `.excalidrawlib`)

### Library File Structure (for reference)
```json
{
  "type": "excalidrawlib",
  "version": 2,
  "source": "https://excalidraw.com",
  "libraryItems": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "status": "published",
      "created": 1732579800000,
      "name": "Diagram Title",
      "description": "Diagram description",
      "elements": [
        // Element array
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Element Properties
Each element includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `type`: rectangle, ellipse, arrow, text, line
- `x`, `y`: Position coordinates
- `width`, `height`: Dimensions
- `strokeColor`, `backgroundColor`: Colors
- `strokeWidth`, `roughness`: Style properties
- `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `textAlign`: Text properties
- `groupIds`: Grouping (optional)
- `startBinding`, `endBinding`: Arrow connections (optional)

## File Storage Convention

All excalidraw files should be saved in:

```
{workspace_root}/excalidraw-diagrams/{context}/*.excalidraw.md
```

Where `{context}` represents the context-specific subdirectory based on:
- Current project/workspace name
- Expert domain (e.g., `backend`, `frontend`, `deployment`)
- Feature or component being visualized

### Examples
- `excalidraw-diagrams/backend/agentic-service-architecture.excalidraw.md`
- `excalidraw-diagrams/frontend/component-hierarchy.excalidraw.md`
- `excalidraw-diagrams/deployment/ci-cd-pipeline.excalidraw.md`
